#### About this project
 
The goal of this project was to create a simple, quick hearing test that measures how well a person can understand speech in a noisy environment.  
 
#### About the data
 
In the evaluation phase of the study, four observations were collected from each of 16 participants, for four versions of this hearing test (French and English, male and female voices). 
 
#### About the code
 
The Rmd file contains code for conducting an analysis of variance and follow-up tests, to see if participants performed differently on different versions of the test. The Rmd file also contains code for plots of the data.
 
#### Results
 
The jpeg files are copies of the data plots.
